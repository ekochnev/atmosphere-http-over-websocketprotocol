The main idea of this project is:

Since there are not any standards how to use Web Socket in exist Java Web Frameworks still I got an idea to propagate http request over web socket to have a ability to integrate it with exist web frameworks based on http interaction.
Especially this project implements integration for the Atmosphere Framework with REST (Jersey).

Now there are two implementation of the WebSocketProtocol:

1. The JsonWebSocketProtocol - which uses JSON for pass http request via Web Socket body.

2. The RawWebSocketProtocol - which uses RAW format of http request by HTTP standards via Web Socket body.
(Under developing and testing still)

Also there is the jquery.http.js to form http request on the client side.
Probably I will move it as separate project.
